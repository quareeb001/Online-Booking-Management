One of the biggest benefits of using email to communicate with customers is its wide usage. 📧 In fact, 92% of online adults use email, with 61% using it daily. 💻🌍

Additionally, around 105 billion emails are sent each day, and this number is expected to reach 246 billion. 📥

Not only do people use email for personal connections, but 61% of consumers also prefer to be contacted by brands through email. 📩

The good news doesn't end there! 🎉 An impressive 99% of email users check their email daily, with some checking as much as 20 times a day. 📥🔍

Email marketing surpasses other online strategies, including SEO, PPC, and content marketing. It is a cost-effective method to promote products, communicate with customers, and achieve business goals. 💼💰

Emails provide a closer connection with customers, offering personalized content tailored to their interests. It's a 1:1 engagement channel that doesn't rely on customers visiting a website or seeing print advertisements. ✉️🤝

With an effective email marketing strategy, you can expand your audience, generate leads, acquire new customers, retain existing ones, increase customer lifetime value (LTV), personalize communication, boost conversions, gather valuable metrics, and ultimately increase revenue.💸
